	<p><br>HX3.5 Wifi module may be operated in <b>Access Point</b> or
		<b>Client/Station</b> mode.</p>
	<p>In <b>Acces Point mode</b>, WiFi module acts as a simple web
		server, creating it's own WiFi net named &quot;HX3.5 Touch OSC&quot; on <b>IP 192.168.4.1</b> or
		&quot;make_osc.local&quot;, default password is &quot;password&quot;. Note: Android devices will not
		accept &quot;hx3.local&quot; as a valid URL, so you have to type the IP address instead.
	</p>
	<p>Access Point mode is advisable when your home wireless network is out of
		reach. TouchOSC must be configured with IP address 192.168.4.1 to access the
		module. You may change SSID and password on <a href="../">configuration page</a>.</p>
	<p>In <b>Client/Station mode</b>, TouchOSC Bridge will register
		itself on your home network router from which it will receive it's IP address,
		eg. &quot;192.168.178.65&quot;. TouchOSC must be configured with the IP address displayed
		by your router web page to access the module.</p>
	<p>To enable Client/Station mode, set <b>Force Access Point mode</b> to <b>off</b>. Click on <b>Select...</b>.
		The list will show all WiFi nets found on startup. Select your home
		network from list and enter your router's password. Click <b>Submit</b>. Mode settings are
		valid after power cycle.</p>
	<p>TouchOSC Bridge will try to connect your home network preferably. You may
		force it to Access Point mode by checking the <b>Force Access Point mode</b>
		box.</p>
	<p><b>UDP Delay</b> (default: 2ms) will pause TouchOSC transmission for some milliseconds
		before sending the next packet. If you experience data loss on your tablet or smartphone (i.e.
		preset changes from HX3.5 are not fully displayed), set this value to a few
		milliseconds more.</p>
	<p><b>UDP Client Timeout</b> (default: 300s) will disable control feedback after a specific amount of time, i.e. a 
		TouchOSC device has	been permanently removed.</p>
	<p><b>Feedback to sending OSC clients</b> (default: ON) will transmit control changes on user
		interface to other TouchOSC clients. Up to 4 TouchOSC devices (tablets/smartphones) may be connected to 
		WiFi module. You may even work with different TouchOSC user interfaces on the
		same OSC bridge, ie. one tablet for upper manual controls, second tablet for lower.</p>
	<p><b>Feedback to other OSC client (self)</b> (default: ON) will transmit control changes on user
		interface back to sending TouchOSC client. This is usefull when an user control is present
		on more than one page or a knob needs to be "quantized" for detents.</p>
